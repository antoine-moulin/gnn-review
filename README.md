# Graph Neural Networks review

This is a short review on Graph Neural Networks done during a course given by [Michal Valko](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~valko/hp/mva-ml-graphs.php) for the Master's degree Mathematics, Vision, Learning (MVA) from ENS Paris-Saclay.

The project was advised by [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/) and [RÃ©my Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/). Unlike other reviews, it tries to quickly present the concepts and recent advances around Graph Neural Networks, and focus on an example, the shortest path problem.
